Installation
============

Just copy the `lightsearch` folder into your project path.

Set it up
=========

Edit your `settings.py` file and add `lightsearch` to the `INSTALLED_APPS`
list. Now, you have to define which models have to be included in the search
queries. Stay in your `settings.py` file and add the `LIGHTSEARCH_MODELS`
setting. This setting is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a model. Its
first part is its verbose name (ie: the human readable name) and the second is
the link to the model (ie: something link <application_name>.<model>). Here is
an example::

    LIGHTSEARCH_MODELS = [
        # ('Verbose name', '<appname>.<model>'),
        ('Ticket', 'myapp.ticket'),
        ('Author', 'myapp.author'),
    ]

It's okay for the `settings.py` file, except if you want to specify which
method to use to send search forms (lightsearch uses POST by default). If you
want so, add this line to your `settings.py`::

    LIGHTSEARCH_METHOD = 'post' # Must be 'post' or 'get' 

Right. Now, you have to set which fields of your models have to be included in
the search queries. To do so, go in your `models.py` file(s), and add in your
models a `Lightsearch` class containing a `fields` list. Here is an example::

    class Author(models.Model):
        """
            An author who write a lot of tickets
        
            >>> jack = Author.objects.create(name="jack",\
                address="jack@example.com", bio="I love Django")
            >>> jack.name
            "jack"
        
        """
        name = models.CharField('Name', max_length=200)
        address = models.CharField('Address', max_length=200)
        bio = models.TextField('Life')
    
        def __unicode__(self):
            return '%s (%s)' % (self.name, self.address)
    
        class Lightsearch:
            fields = ['name', 'bio']

Next, you have to add the templates directory of Lightsearch in your `settings.py`. Here is an example:

    # Those two lines are needed
    import os
    ROOT_PATH = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

    # A part of your settings.py there

    TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
        os.path.join(ROOT_PATH, 'templates'),   # This line doesn't matter:
                                                # just for example
        os.path.join(ROOT_PATH, 'lightsearch', 'templates'), # Add this line
    )

    # The end of your setting.py

Finally, you have to add one line in your `urls.py` to indicate where the
search queries must be send::

    (r'^search/', include('lightsearch.urls')),

That's it. Now you can read the next part of the guide: the USAGE file.
